# Welcome!

## What is this project?
Starting point is a new Repo where i try to create something with JavaFX.

## Why?
I created this to test my abilities to create and copy from the internet, but not because i want to steal, i want to improve myself with new frameworks.

## How do i use this simple project?

For now you need to clone the entire repo with IntelliJ and check Launcher.java to know what you need to start.

Mabye in the next month i will do an .exe or something like this, i don't know right now.
